**😊 Auto Capture Selfie by Detecting Smile**

This project uses **Python** and **OpenCV** to automatically capture a selfie when a smile is detected in real-time via webcam. It provides a fun, hands-free, and interactive way to take selfies using computer vision.

📌 Features-
- Real-time **face and smile detection**
- **Automatic selfie capture** on detecting a smile
- Saves the image locally without any manual action
- Uses **Haarcascade XML classifiers** for detection

🛠️ Technologies Used-
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Haarcascade Classifiers (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`, `haarcascade_smile.xml`)

▶️ How to Run-
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
Place the Haarcascade XML files in the same directory as main.py.

Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py

💾 Output-
Captured image is saved as smile_captured.jpg in the project directory.
To quit the live video, press q.

📈 Future Improvements-
Countdown timer before capture
Enhanced smile detection using CNN
Mobile version with front camera access
Group smile detection
